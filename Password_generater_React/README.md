Check out the project website: [fortifykey.com](https://fortifykey.netlify.app/) üåê

## About

FortifyKey is a powerful password generating application built using Django Rest Framework and ReactJS. This project represents an experiment where I utilized the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop the application. The development process involved using different AI tools for code writing, UI building, and code documentation.

**Caution:** A complete understanding of how a full-stack application works is required for successful implementation; otherwise, AI assistance may not be sufficient.

### Tools Used:

1. **Building UI:** [Screenshot to Code](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code) by [abhi](https://github.com/abi).
2. **Generating Code:** ChatGPT 3.5, Bard with relevant prompts.
3. **Documentation:** Cody AI VSCode extension.

## Features:

- **Password Generation:** FortifyKey allows users to generate random, strong passwords with just a few clicks. The generated passwords are designed to be secure and can be customized based on user preferences.

- **Unique Passwords:** Each generated password is unique, enhancing the security of user accounts and sensitive information.

- **Email Functionality:** Users have the option to send generated passwords to their email address directly from the application, providing a convenient way to store and access the generated passwords.
